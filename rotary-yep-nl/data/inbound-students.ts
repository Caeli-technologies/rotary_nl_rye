    name: 'Aiden Almaraz',
    bio: 'Hello, my name is Aiden Almaraz and I am from Roger, Arkansas which is North East of Texas. Most people ask me, why leave the U.S and come here? Well the reason is because I\'ve wanted to experience the world since I was young due to my grandma. She has traveled all over the world and has experienced so many things I won\'t even experience. She would tell me bed time stories of her adventures. When I got older I heard of this opportunity and I grabbed it and didn\'t let go. I\'m currently staying in Eemnes with my wonderful host family. Out of this year I want to learn a third language and become well embedded with the culture here.',

Now I live in Venlo, in Limburg. That means a lot of traditions and different dialects every 5 km. Limbourg is, for me, the family oriented part of The Netherlands. I wanted to go on RYE because since I was a child my dream was going abroad, visiting the world, meet new people, making connections… I\'m in the youngest part of rotary (interact) so for me it\'s was the perfect thing to do. Continue in my Rotary way and in the same realize my dream. I want to become fluent in Dutch, make friends for like, and "live the country" like a real Dutchie. This year will be the best of my life.',

This year I want to learn the language, culture, get to know the gastronomy, I really want to learn urban legends about this country, meet new people, get to know a different reality than what I was used to, but the most important thing is that I want to grow as a person, I want to be the best version of myself, I want to give my best so that more people can fulfill their dreams just like I did, I want to achieve every goal that I set for myself, I want to help others in everything I can, I want to bring innovative things to Chile, things that can really contribute to us; But more than just wanting this, I know that I will achieve everything I set out to do.',
