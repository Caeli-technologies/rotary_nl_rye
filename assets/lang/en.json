Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.",

    "nikkiMureauBio": "I am Nikki, head of the inbound committee of Rotex!\n\nIn 2017-2018 I did my exchange in the most beautiful place of the world: Colombia! I lived on the tiny island called San Andres, located in the Caribbean sea. It's an absolutely beautiful place, where I got to enjoy the nice weather, beaches, warm-heartedness of the people, and the bright and lively culture. I also got to explore the mainland of Colombia, and saw a lot of different big cities, small villages and the gorgeous nature like the Amazon and Valle de Cocora.\n\nNot a day passes by where I don't think of Colombia, and I continue to talk to my hostfamily. I can notice Colombia really became a part of me, and will always be for the rest of my life.\n\nCurrently I am studying Industrial Design at the Technical University of Eindhoven. I really love that I am still involved in the RYE program through Rotex. Especially in the Inbound committee I stay in contact with exchange students in the Netherlands. The weekends we organize with Rotex for the inbounders are super fun, and I am happy that I get to show the Netherlands to the students, while I also continue to learn from their nationalities!\n\nThis coming year I get to be the next chairman of Rotex. I am super excited to set up the RYE program again for next year and help students realize the most amazing year of their lives!\n\nFor any questions, comments, suggestions, or collaborations I am happy to contact with you through LinkedIn, or you can call me",
    "fynnBootsBio": "Hee ik ben Fynn en ben lid van de commissie inbound bij rotex. In 2018/2019 ben ik op exchange geweest naar Argentini√´ in een klein dorpje genaamd Armstrongüá¶üá∑. Mijn exchange heeft me veel meer gebracht dan dat ik van tevoren had gedacht. Naast het leven in een totaal verschillende wereld, heb ik nieuwe vrienden voor het leven gemaakt (vooral met de andere exchange studenten), een nieuwe taal geleerd en ontzettend mooie reizen gemaakt. Een exchange gaat niet alleen maar over rozengeurüåπen manen schijnüåúmaar juist van die moeilijkere momenten heb ik heel veel geleerd.\n\nOp dit moment studeer ik hospitality management in Amsterdam. In Argentini√´ besefte ik me dat werken in de hospitality echt mijn droom is en die ga ik nu achterna!\n\nIk gun iedereen zo‚Äôn kans! Stuur me gerust een berichtje als je meer wil wetenüòÅ",
