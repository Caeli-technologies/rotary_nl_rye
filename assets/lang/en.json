Ik zat in het dorpje Huwei in de provincie Yunlin.\n\nTijdens mijn exchange heb ik veel van Taiwan kunnen zien, en heb ik door het exchange programma vrienden van over de hele wereld gemaakt.\n\nOnderhand studeer ik Psychologie in Amsterdam, en hoop ik dat we als Rotex zo snel mogelijk weer nieuwe exchange studenten het jaar van hun leven kunnen geven!",
  "fleurHeupersBio": "Hey, I'm Fleur, I'm a member of the PR/External committee. In 2018/2019 I went to Brazil and how cool was that!!! I had two amazing families here, got to travel a lot and met a lot of people that I still talk to today. At the moment I am training to be an Officer Pilot at the Royal Military Academy in Breda. Here too I am enjoying myself immensely. Even now I notice every day that my Exchange Year contributes to my personal development, something I am very busy with in my training. I can therefore recommend everyone not to miss out on such a great adventure. Do you have questions about me, my Exchange Year or my education? Do not hesitate to send me a message!",

  "pascalStompBio": "Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.",
