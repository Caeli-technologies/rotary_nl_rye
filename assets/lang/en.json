    "kylianHesselinkBio": "Hi I am Kylian and I am the president of Rotex🔨. In 2016-2017 I went on an exchange to Mexico🇲🇽, which is obviously the coolest country on the planet. Because who doesn't want to be able to celebrate Christmas on a sunny beach with a coconut🧉 in hand? The RYE has been the fattest experience of my life where I not only did a lot of fun things but also developed myself. I will also always carry a piece of Mexico with me.\n\nI just finished my bachelor in Sustainable Innovation and am working for half a year before I start my master. Besides that, I spend my days missing Rotex💔, the nicest people walking around in the Netherlands 😌",
    "toonTerEllenBio": "Hi there! My name is Toon ter Ellen and I am the current treasurer of Rotex! 💰In the year 2016-2017 I went on exchange to Campo Grande in Brasil, the best year of my life! ❤️🇧🇷 This experience has been so amazing, I can absolutely recommend it to everyone 🤩\n\nAt the moment I am studying Law at Radboud University in Nijmegen. I very much hope we can soon start with organising Rotex activities again 😎",

Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.",
    "victorStormBio": "Ik ben Victor, en ik ben hoofd van commissie extern.\n\nWij regelen de social media accounts en houden ons bezig met de media-taken van Rotex.\n\nIk ben zelf in het jaar 2017-2018 naar Taiwan geweest. Ik zat in het dorpje Huwei in de provincie Yunlin.\n\nTijdens mijn exchange heb ik veel van Taiwan kunnen zien, en heb ik door het exchange programma vrienden van over de hele wereld gemaakt.\n\nOnderhand studeer ik Psychologie in Amsterdam, en hoop ik dat we als Rotex zo snel mogelijk weer nieuwe exchange studenten het jaar van hun leven kunnen geven!",

    "nikkiMureauBio": "I am Nikki, head of the inbound committee of Rotex!\n\nIn 2017-2018 I did my exchange in the most beautiful place of the world: Colombia! I lived on the tiny island called San Andres, located in the Caribbean sea. It's an absolutely beautiful place, where I got to enjoy the nice weather, beaches, warm-heartedness of the people, and the bright and lively culture. I also got to explore the mainland of Colombia, and saw a lot of different big cities, small villages and the gorgeous nature like the Amazon and Valle de Cocora.\n\nNot a day passes by where I don't think of Colombia, and I continue to talk to my hostfamily. I can notice Colombia really became a part of me, and will always be for the rest of my life.\n\nCurrently I am studying Industrial Design at the Technical University of Eindhoven. I really love that I am still involved in the RYE program through Rotex. Especially in the Inbound committee I stay in contact with exchange students in the Netherlands. The weekends we organize with Rotex for the inbounders are super fun, and I am happy that I get to show the Netherlands to the students, while I also continue to learn from their nationalities!\n\nThis coming year I get to be the next chairman of Rotex. I am super excited to set up the RYE program again for next year and help students realize the most amazing year of their lives!\n\nFor any questions, comments, suggestions, or collaborations I am happy to contact with you through LinkedIn, or you can call me",
    "fynnBootsBio": "Hee ik ben Fynn en ben lid van de commissie inbound bij rotex. In 2018/2019 ben ik op exchange geweest naar Argentinië in een klein dorpje genaamd Armstrong🇦🇷. Mijn exchange heeft me veel meer gebracht dan dat ik van tevoren had gedacht. Naast het leven in een totaal verschillende wereld, heb ik nieuwe vrienden voor het leven gemaakt (vooral met de andere exchange studenten), een nieuwe taal geleerd en ontzettend mooie reizen gemaakt. Een exchange gaat niet alleen maar over rozengeur🌹en manen schijn🌜maar juist van die moeilijkere momenten heb ik heel veel geleerd.\n\nOp dit moment studeer ik hospitality management in Amsterdam. In Argentinië besefte ik me dat werken in de hospitality echt mijn droom is en die ga ik nu achterna!\n\nIk gun iedereen zo’n kans! Stuur me gerust een berichtje als je meer wil weten😁",
    "daniekKoningBio": "Hii! Im Daniek, 19 years old and I’m currently studying age friendly design and innovation at Windesheim in Zwolle. In 2018/2019 I went on exchange to Canada 🇨🇦. I lived in a really small town called High River. Here I had a beautiful view of the Rocky Mountains!🏔 Going on exchange was one of the best experiences of my life. I met so many great people, I saw some awesome places and learned a lot! I am currently on the inbound committee where we organize fun activities for exchange students who are coming to the Netherlands.",
