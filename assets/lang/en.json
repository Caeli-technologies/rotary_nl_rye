  "victorStormBio": "Ik ben Victor, en ik ben hoofd van commissie extern.\n\nWij regelen de social media accounts en houden ons bezig met de media-taken van Rotex.\n\nIk ben zelf in het jaar 2017-2018 naar Taiwan geweest. Ik zat in het dorpje Huwei in de provincie Yunlin.\n\nTijdens mijn exchange heb ik veel van Taiwan kunnen zien, en heb ik door het exchange programma vrienden van over de hele wereld gemaakt.\n\nOnderhand studeer ik Psychologie in Amsterdam, en hoop ik dat we als Rotex zo snel mogelijk weer nieuwe exchange studenten het jaar van hun leven kunnen geven!",
  "fleurHeupersBio": "Hey, I'm Fleur, I'm a member of the PR/External committee. In 2018/2019 I went to Brazil and how cool was that!!! I had two amazing families here, got to travel a lot and met a lot of people that I still talk to today. At the moment I am training to be an Officer Pilot at the Royal Military Academy in Breda. Here too I am enjoying myself immensely. Even now I notice every day that my Exchange Year contributes to my personal development, something I am very busy with in my training. I can therefore recommend everyone not to miss out on such a great adventure. Do you have questions about me, my Exchange Year or my education? Do not hesitate to send me a message!",

  "nikkiMureauBio": "I am Nikki, head of the inbound committee of Rotex!\n\nIn 2017-2018 I did my exchange in the most beautiful place of the world: Colombia! I lived on the tiny island called San Andres, located in the Caribbean sea. It's an absolutely beautiful place, where I got to enjoy the nice weather, beaches, warm-heartedness of the people, and the bright and lively culture. I also got to explore the mainland of Colombia, and saw a lot of different big cities, small villages and the gorgeous nature like the Amazon and Valle de Cocora.\n\nNot a day passes by where I don't think of Colombia, and I continue to talk to my hostfamily. I can notice Colombia really became a part of me, and will always be for the rest of my life.\n\nCurrently I am studying Industrial Design at the Technical University of Eindhoven. I really love that I am still involved in the RYE program through Rotex. Especially in the Inbound committee I stay in contact with exchange students in the Netherlands. The weekends we organize with Rotex for the inbounders are super fun, and I am happy that I get to show the Netherlands to the students, while I also continue to learn from their nationalities!\n\nThis coming year I get to be the next chairman of Rotex. I am super excited to set up the RYE program again for next year and help students realize the most amazing year of their lives!\n\nFor any questions, comments, suggestions, or collaborations I am happy to contact with you through LinkedIn, or you can call me",

  "pascalStompBio": "Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.",
