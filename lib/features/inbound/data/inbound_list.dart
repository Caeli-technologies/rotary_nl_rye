I have taken two years of culinary classes at my school and found out that I really enjoy cooking! Something about trying out new recipes and spending time in the kitchen is very nice and calming for me. Of course with cooking always comes baking and who doesn‚Äôt look a good homemade cookie. Baking is fun for me because I have a big sweet tooth and love trying out all the different ways to make sweet treats.',

        'When I got the assignment to write this text, I was on the road with a friend and doing what I love to do: travelling. On that day we were first in Thun, the city of my birth, and later in Basel, a very big and important city in Switzerland. My best friend and I have already travelled to all the important places in Switzerland by train. \n\nMy name is Nathalie, I\'m 16 years old and I live in Baden, a small industrial, spa and cultural town near Zurich. I go to the Gymnasium at the Kantonsschule Wettingen. I enjoy the school building with the surrounding park, which it was originally a monastery. In class, I\'m mainly interested in French, economics and chemistry. My favourite colour is blue and my favourite food is lasagne, although my favourite cat Garfield is orange and doesn\'t eat lasagne. Needless to say, it is not easy for me to leave him and my family for a year. But I\'m looking forward to seeing new things, learning Dutch, making contact with lots of exciting people while having lots of fun.',
