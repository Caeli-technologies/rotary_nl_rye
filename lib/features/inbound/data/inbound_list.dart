Well the reason is because Iâ€™ve wanted to experience the world since I was young due to my grandma. She has traveled all over the world and has experienced so many things I wonâ€™t even experience. She would tell me bed time stories of her edventures. When I got older I heard of this opportunity and I grabbed it and didnâ€™t let go. Iâ€™m currently staying in Eemnes with my wonderful host family. Out of this year I want to learn a third language and become well embedded with the culture here. ',

It is a very eco-friendly country, with solar panels, windmills and bicycles (I love cycling). I also want to learn Dutch, as we have Dutch-speaking neighbors (Suriname). During my stay here, I plan to explore more and more Dutch culture, learn the language, make friends and visit the most famous places in the country.',

        'Hi, I\'m Duda, from Brazil, and I\'m staying in the city of Haaksbergen, NL. I have wanted to do an exchange since I was twelve years old, I have always been curious to know a new language, culture and customs, Rotary is providing this for me. During this year of exchange I hope to get to know the country and its customs, in addition to growing as a person, with more responsibilities and deciding which way to follow in the future ðŸ˜€',
