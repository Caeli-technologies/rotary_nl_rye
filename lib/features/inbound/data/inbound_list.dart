My Rotary club in Brazil is Rotary Club Bauru Vitória Régia and my district is 4510.\n\n In the Netherlands, I’m living in Maarssen, a city next to Utrecht. I’m being hosted by the Rotary Club Maarssen, in district 1570.\n\n In Brazil, my house has 6nmembers: my mother, who participates in the Rotary Club Bauru Vitória Régia; my father, who works very hard; my sister, who is in the university studying to be a dentist; me, who participated in the Interact Club Bauru Aeroporto, and my two pets: a cat and a dog.\n\n I love reading and listening to music. My favorite book is “Enquanto eu não te encontro”, a Brazilian book by Pedro Rhuas, and my favorite singer is Lana Del Rey.\n\n I always wanted to do an exchange program, visit another country, learn a new language. I know about the Rotary and the RYE since I was a kid because some of my cousins already did the program.\n\n I hope I can meet a lot of people, make a lot of friends and learn Dutch. \n\n I’m so happy of finally making my dream come true in an amazing country!',

My favorite ones are my vibes which I cut and propagated myself.
